uiuc-denied
===========

This bad code checks when you get denied from UIUC.

You'll need:
- a pushover account (they have 7-day free trials) for all platforms
- a MyIllini login
- a working Go >1.11 installation

Copy .sample-credentials to .credentials. Fill in your credentials. Make sure to escape everything properly. Run it with start.sh.

GLHF!
